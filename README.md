Hello and welcome to a project that I have built from scratch as a practice project for [Launch School - an online school for developers](https://launchschool.com) in preparation for the school's Front-end development final exam.

This is my attempt at the recreation, from scratch, of this single page application: http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/websushi/#/, sans carousel animations when looking at the menu items in detail, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone, and Handlebars.

This repository is mainly to serve as a personal journal of what I can achieve at this point in time since starting my education with Launch School ~7 months ago.
